task1:
1.
CREATE TABLE Authors (
    Author_ID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Books (

Primary Key :
its a main key of the table , does not allow to be null , does not allow to be redundant 

Unique Constraint:
its allow to be null , does not allow to be redundant.

yes the table can contain both of primary key and unique constraint.


task2:

1.
Customers

| customer_id | customer_name |

Orders

| order_id | customer_id |

Products

| product_id | product_name | product_price |

Order_Details

| order_id | product_id |

Partial dependency and transitive dependency are issues that happen in database tables when they are not normalized well. Partial dependency happens when a non-key attribute depends on only part of a composite primary key. For example in an Enrollment(student_id, course_id, student_name) table, the primary key is student_id and course_id together, but student_name depends only on student_id. This causes repetition of data and breaks 2NF. Transitive dependency is when a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute instead of directly on the primary key. For example in an Employee(emp_id, dept_id, dept_name) table, emp_id determines dept_id and dept_id determines dept_name, so dept_name depends on emp_id indirectly. This causes unnecessary data duplication and violates 3NF.

task5:
data is a raw data without processing.
information is raw data with processing.
data base is a structure that organizes data inside tables in order to ensure safety of data.
dbms is a software that is used to make users on a single database manage the databses depending on the roles and restrictions of the roles given by the admin.
rdbms are relational databases such as oracle and MySQL.

a hospital uses the database system in order to log the data into the records of 
the database where they will use the information that are provided to them by the patients like 
their names and the information that is needed in order to log it into the system and make the
 patient profile where they will be remembered through the data base in order to have a refrence if they ever visit the hospital again
 and not have to go througt the logging their information process everytime they get into the hospital.
